# JTS-HW6-PythonAPI

This week’s homework assignment focused on using APIs to gather data and create graphs and charts.  Using data outside of our sterile data science bootcamp environment requires an understanding of errors and ways to avoid errors crashing your program.  Another important aspect of this week’s work is the budgeting of resources (specifically cash) when using APIs.  The free OpenweatherMap API allows for up to 60 calls per minute but trying to run the entire program at once will cause you to “go beyond your limit”.  The google API requires to sign up with a credit card so care needs to be taken when using this service.  WeatherPy homework asked us to get the weather of 500 random cities and use this data to create weather conditions vs latitude.  VacationPy homework took the 500 cities and plotted a heat map using google maps using humidity.  We then took this list and reduced it to ideal places to visit base on weather conditions.  Using google search, we returned a list of hotels in each city and placed it on the heatmap with a tag of the city, country and name of the hotel.
